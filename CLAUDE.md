# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
# Full-stack (Dockerized) — builds and runs both postgres and the API
docker-compose up -d

# Hybrid (local dev) — starts only the database; run the API separately
docker-compose up -d postgres
./gradlew bootRun

# Build
./gradlew build

# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run a single test class
./gradlew test --tests "com.example.climbingapi.ClimbingProjectApplicationTests"
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:8080`. Swagger UI is available at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

## Environment

Copy `.env` values as environment variables before running. The app reads `POSTGRES_DB`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` from the environment (see `application.yaml`).

```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

Requires **Java 21** (the Gradle toolchain will download it automatically if not present).

## Architecture

Kotlin + Spring Boot 3.5 REST API backed by **PostgreSQL 16**. Uses **Spring Data JDBC** (`JdbcTemplate`) with hand-written SQL — there is no JPA/ORM.

**Layer flow:** `Controller → Service → Repository`

- `controller/` — REST handlers. Delegates all logic to services and mappers; no business logic here.
- `service/` — Business logic. Throws `NotFoundException` when entities are missing.
- `repository/` — Raw SQL via `JdbcTemplate` with inline `RowMapper` lambdas. Uses `RETURNING` clauses on inserts to avoid a second query.
- `model/` — Plain Kotlin data classes (no annotations). `id` and `createdAt` are nullable since they are DB-assigned.
- `dto/` — Request/response classes. Requests use Bean Validation annotations (`@NotBlank`, `@Min`, `@Email`, etc.). Required fields are non-nullable; optional fields are `String?`/`Int?`. Response DTOs use non-nullable types for fields guaranteed by the DB schema.
- `mapper/` — Spring `@Component` classes that convert between `model` and `dto` types.
- `exception/` — `GlobalExceptionHandler` (`@RestControllerAdvice`) centralises error responses. All 404s come from `NotFoundException`.

## Implemented endpoints

| Method | Path | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| GET | `/api/climbing-areas` | List all areas; supports `?page=0&size=20` (max 100) |
| GET | `/api/walls` | List all walls; supports `?page=0&size=20` (max 100) |
| GET | `/api/walls/{id}` | 404 if not found |
| POST | `/api/walls` | Returns 201; `areaId` required |
| GET | `/api/walls/{wallId}/routes` | 404 if wall not found |
| PUT | `/api/walls/{id}` | Full replace; 404 if not found |
| GET | `/api/routes` | List all routes; supports `?page=0&size=20` (max 100) |
| GET | `/api/routes/{id}` | 404 if not found |
| POST | `/api/routes` | Returns 201; validates wall exists |
| PUT | `/api/routes/{id}` | Full replace; validates wall exists; 404 if not found |
| GET | `/api/users` | List all users; supports `?page=0&size=20` (max 100) |
| GET | `/api/users/{id}` | 404 if not found |
| POST | `/api/users` | Returns 201 |
| PUT | `/api/users/{id}` | Full replace; 404 if not found |
| DELETE | `/api/users/{id}` | 204; 409 if user has ticks |
| GET | `/api/users/{userId}/ticks` | List user's ticked routes; supports `?page=0&size=20`; 404 if user not found |
| POST | `/api/users/{userId}/ticks` | Returns 201; validates user + route exist |
| GET | `/api/users/{userId}/ticks/{tickId}` | 404 if user or tick not found |
| PUT | `/api/users/{userId}/ticks/{tickId}` | Update style/rating/personalNote |
| DELETE | `/api/users/{userId}/ticks/{tickId}` | 204; 404 if not found |

All error responses share the shape: `{ timestamp, status, error, errorCode, message, path }`.

## Domain model

```
climbing_areas
    └── walls (FK: area_id, ON DELETE CASCADE)
            └── routes (FK: wall_id, ON DELETE CASCADE)

users
    └── user_route_ticks (FK: user_id + route_id, ON DELETE CASCADE, UNIQUE per pair)
```

All five domain types have a complete Controller/Service/Repository stack.

## Conventions

- Services trim `name` (and `grade` for routes) before persisting.
- Mappers only implement `toResponse()` — there is no `toModel()` direction.
- Unit tests for all 5 services use Mockito (`@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension::class)`) — no Spring context needed.
- All REST endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.
- No authentication or authorisation is implemented yet.
- Multi-step service methods (e.g. validate → insert) are annotated `@Transactional`.
- List endpoints return `PagedResponse<T>` with `data`, `page`, `pageSize`, `total` fields. Size is clamped to max 100 in the service layer.

## Database migrations

Flyway migrations live in `src/main/resources/db/migration/`. New migrations must follow the `V{n}__{description}.sql` naming convention and are applied automatically on startup.

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `V1__create_tables.sql` | Full schema (all 5 tables) |
| `V2__seed_test_data.sql` | Sample wall + routes in Bergen |
| `V3__seed_climbing_areas.sql` | Sample climbing areas + more walls/routes |
| `V4__schema_improvements.sql` | NOT NULL on FK cols, UNIQUE on email + ticks, CASCADE deletes, FK indexes, lat/lng precision |
